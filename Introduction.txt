Setting up the dataset for the deepfake identification:
The word document explains this process with images and greater detail, but essentially:

Please ensure you have correctly input/locate the appropriate directory where the dataset is located. By ensuring this it allows for the data to be loaded and manipluated.

Using Google Colab:

Upload to session storage
* Create a new folder named: Face_Recognition
* Navigate in the directory where the dataset is located
* Navigate to "Olivetti Dataset"
* Upload "olvetti_faces.npy" and "olivetti_faces_target.npy"
* Move the two (2) .npy files into the Face_Recognition folder

Libraries to import/install: 
* pip install numpy
* pip install pandas

Make sure you have correctly installed the imports
