Setting up the dataset for the deepfake identification:
The word document explains this process with images and greater detail, but essentially:

Please ensure you have correctly input/locate the appropriate directory where the dataset is located. By ensuring this it allows for the data to be loaded and manipluated.

Using Google Colab:

Upload to session storage
Create a new folder named: Face_Recognition
Navigate in the directory where the dataset is located
Navigate to "Olivetti Dataset"
Upload "olvetti_faces.npy" and "olivetti_faces_target.npy"
Move the two (2) .npy files into the Face_Recognition folder

Libraries to import/install: 
	pip install numpy
	pip install pandas

Make sure you have correctly installed the imports
